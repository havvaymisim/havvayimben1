“Virtual Impact Calculator”

The user is asked a few simple questions:

How many clothes do you own?

On average, how many times do you wear each item?

At the end, the site calculates and displays the user’s personal clothing footprint.

Then, it provides personalized suggestions on how to reduce that footprint — for example:

“You could lower your impact by 20% if you extend the life of your clothes, donate unused items, or choose sustainable fabrics.” It can bring awareness to the textile pollution. AI can be used for create solutions for it.
